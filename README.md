Description: Algorithm implementations in Python
```

1. Algorithms/problems implemented as Standard python file
    (i) squarematrix_*.py - Create m*n matrix. Fill them with 1s and 0s.
        Algorithm: Identifies the largest square (not rectangle) sub-matrix with 1s

    (ii) djikstras.py - Implementation of Djikstra's algorithm with a few testcases

2. Ipython notebooks 
    (i) FactorialByRecursion.ipynb
	(ii) charactermaxcount.ipynb

```
How to execute these .py files

python <filename>.py instead of ./<filename>.py

Also please note that these files are tested on python3.6 only
```

```
Jupyter notebooks can be run on jupyter as is or copy the contents into a
<filename>.py and execute as python <filename>.py
```


Issues:
    (i) Comments are not well structured and consistent across the files. Need
to refer PEP.
